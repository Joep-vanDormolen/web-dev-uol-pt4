- We should clean up the css to remove unused css, similarities etc.
- Naming css styles could be nicer too, it varies per page.  Lets revise that also.
- Make some of the fonts usage a little nicer.  eg style h1..h5 appropriately
- Maybe some more color around the place, blue is nice, but we shouldnâ€™t be afraid to use other colors also.
- The rubric for this one is responsiveness, and css box styling.  We already have that from bootstrap, so doing the above noted issues will be good.
- Anything else anyone wants to suggest from a look at other peoples work.
- W3C check prior to submission.
